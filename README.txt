Oculus Nano Runtime 1.30
=====================================================
Oculus runtime WITHOUT library manager, store, Oculus Home, nine gigabytes of bloatware and signin requirement.
Just the runtime and drivers.

The installer also deploys a dummy user database so you don't need to be signed in.
The runtime version is 1.30, which is the last one working with the database hacks and w/o Oculus Home.

This version was tested with a DK2. Your mileage may vary. Feel free to contact me if any bugs or issues arise.
This also comes without any warranty. I am not responsible for exploding HMDs, trashed controllers, dead kittens or WW3.
