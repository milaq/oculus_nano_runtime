This is the vendor folder for the original runtime files from Oculus.
These files were intentionally omitted because of copyright reasons.
You can find them compressed somewhere on the internets.

Copy the Oculus runtime contents here (usually from C:\Program Files\Oculus or the zip you downloaded somewhere),
i.e. at least the Manifest and Support folders.
